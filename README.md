# ITCS243-project
## Project repo for Patrick, Kris, Greg, Vadym
Current (not finalized) project idea is a "poker simulator", programmed in Java. Outputs two hands, one visible to the user, the other hidden. User guesses whether visible hand is higher or lower than hidden one.

Greg:
Shuffle
Use a random number generator and data structure to "draw" a card, and remove it from the deck.

Compare hands
Store cards as objects to make shuffling consistent

Kris
Dealing hands
~Blackjack mode~
Reset the deck button / keeping track of whether or not there are enough cards left in the deck
Main menu / intro

## Patrick
### Taking user inputs
Prompt user for inputs and process inputs (choosing which cards to discard, selecting to continue/end game after each round. This will be finished when the program correctly processes user inputs.
### Set aside used hands
Discard all cards from hand and draw new cards, without resetting the game board (cards should not be shuffled back into the deck). This will be finished when the app does not reset the game board between hands, but does reset on user input.
