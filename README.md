Current (not finalized) project idea is a "poker simulator", programmed in Java. Outputs two hands, one visible to the user, the other hidden. User guesses whether visible hand is higher or lower than hidden one.

Greg:
  Shuffle
  Compare hands
  Store cards as objects to make shuffling consistent

Kris
  Dealing hands
     -Deals 5 cards face-up for User and 5 facedown. Should display 10 cards total for the user to see.
  Reset the deck button / keeping track of whether or not there are enough cards left in the deck
     -A command to reshuffle the deck if there are too few cards. Displays the command after each deal.
  Main menu / intro
     - A "welcome" message explaining the game and how to play.
